    <h2>Develop in Swift</h2>
    <p>Content and information on my Swift development journey... Unit 1: Values

Unit 1.1 - 1.2
Inputs and Outputs in Programming

Inputs: What we provide to the computer.
Outputs: The result after processing the inputs.
Both of these are referred to as values.
Data and Expressions

Data: A collection of individual values.
Expression: A term used to represent a value in programming.
Programming languages have various ways to express and manipulate data.
Naming and Abstraction
Abstraction Through Naming

Naming is a form of abstraction. When people use a name to refer to something, they think of the best way to briefly represent what’s in front of them.
Identifiers in Programming

In programming, names are called identifiers.
Identifiers should clearly reflect the programmer's intention, making it easier for others to collaborate and debug the code.
Camel Case is commonly used in Swift to name identifiers (e.g., myVariableName).
Constants vs Variables
Constants

Constants are values that do not change throughout the program.
They help reduce mistakes, as programmers can rely on these values remaining the same.
Example: Eye color is a constant.
Variables

Variables change during program execution.
Example: Hair length is a variable, as it can change over time.
Strings and Characters
Text Values as Strings

Text values are called strings in programming.
Strings are made up of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, and symbols).
The term "string" is used because characters are arranged in a specific sequence.
Simulations in Programming
Using Simulations to Model Systems

Simulations are often used by programmers to replicate systems and predict behaviors.
By modeling a system through a simulation, people can observe how the system responds to changes and test hypotheses.
Building a Simulation

Programmers must consider which aspects of the system will be modeled and how these aspects will change.
Simulations rely heavily on variables.
Computer simulations are powerful because they can compute a large number of values for each variable and model complex interactions between variables.</p>

    <h2>Collegeboard Summary</h2>
    <p>This is the summary of my Collegeboard projects and activities. 1.1 Collaboration
Importance of Collaboration: Collaboration in computing helps foster innovation by incorporating diverse talents and perspectives. This diversity can prevent bias in the development of computing innovations, which can be:

Physical (e.g., self-driving cars)
Non-physical software (e.g., picture editing software)
Non-physical concepts (e.g., e-commerce)
Skills Gained: Effective collaboration enhances communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation.

Ways to Collaborate:

Pair Programming: One programmer acts as the "driver" while the other as the "pointer."
Think-Pair-Share: Students first think through a problem alone, then pair up and share their ideas or results.
Collaboration Tools:

Leave comments in the code.
Apps used in class: Repl.it, GitHub.
1.2 Program Function and Purpose
Purpose of Computing Innovations: The primary purpose is to solve problems or enable creative expression. Developers need to understand this purpose to improve their ability to develop these innovations.

Types of Computing Innovations:

Applications
Systems
Physical Devices
Guiding Questions:

Why does the computing innovation exist?
What problems does the innovation solve?
What does the innovation allow us to do that we couldn’t do before?
Key Concepts:

Event-Driven Programs: Most programs operate in an event-driven environment, where events (triggered by user actions or other programs) send inputs to the program. The program responds by executing the corresponding code segment and generating output.
1.3 Program Design and Development
Steps to Develop a Program:

Investigation: Understand the problem, requirements, constraints, and user concerns. Surveys and developer responses can help.
Planning: Brainstorm ideas, create a storyboard, and plan the user interface. Organize modules and develop a testing strategy.
Common Programming Errors:

Runtime Error: The program fails during execution.
Syntax Error: Mistakes in the code, like typos.
Logic Error: The algorithm is incorrect due to a programmer's mistake.
Overflow Error: The program attempts a calculation that exceeds defined range values.
