    <h2>Collegeboard Summary</h2>
    <p>This is the summary of my Collegeboard projects and activities. 1.1 Collaboration
Importance of Collaboration: Collaboration in computing helps foster innovation by incorporating diverse talents and perspectives. This diversity can prevent bias in the development of computing innovations, which can be:

Physical (e.g., self-driving cars)
Non-physical software (e.g., picture editing software)
Non-physical concepts (e.g., e-commerce)
Skills Gained: Effective collaboration enhances communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation.

Ways to Collaborate:

Pair Programming: One programmer acts as the "driver" while the other as the "pointer."
Think-Pair-Share: Students first think through a problem alone, then pair up and share their ideas or results.
Collaboration Tools:

Leave comments in the code.
Apps used in class: Repl.it, GitHub.
1.2 Program Function and Purpose
Purpose of Computing Innovations: The primary purpose is to solve problems or enable creative expression. Developers need to understand this purpose to improve their ability to develop these innovations.

Types of Computing Innovations:

Applications
Systems
Physical Devices
Guiding Questions:

Why does the computing innovation exist?
What problems does the innovation solve?
What does the innovation allow us to do that we couldnâ€™t do before?
Key Concepts:

Event-Driven Programs: Most programs operate in an event-driven environment, where events (triggered by user actions or other programs) send inputs to the program. The program responds by executing the corresponding code segment and generating output.
1.3 Program Design and Development
Steps to Develop a Program:

Investigation: Understand the problem, requirements, constraints, and user concerns. Surveys and developer responses can help.
Planning: Brainstorm ideas, create a storyboard, and plan the user interface. Organize modules and develop a testing strategy.
Common Programming Errors:

Runtime Error: The program fails during execution.
Syntax Error: Mistakes in the code, like typos.
Logic Error: The algorithm is incorrect due to a programmer's mistake.
Overflow Error: The program attempts a calculation that exceeds defined range values.
